## Compiling

### Prerequisites

In order to compile this project, you will need:

* [DirectX 5.0 SDK][archive-directx]
* [Watcom 10.6][winworld-watcom]
* [Windows 95 DDK][winworld-winddk]

Add the header files and compiler directories to your `INCLUDE` and `PATH` environment variables, respectively. For example:

```
SET PATH=C:\WATCOM\BINNT;C:\WATCOM\BINW;%PATH%

```

### Compiling the game

You can compile the Windows 95 version of Birthright (which runs on operating systems up to Windows 11) by running:

`MAKE.BAT WIN95`

DOS will also compile (on versions of Windows up to Windows ME), but currently has some missing fonts.

### Updating Version Numbers
